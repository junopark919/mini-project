# Circular Progress Bar

The Circular Progress Bar is a project that I created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It showcases a visually appealing circular progress bar with animated progress indicators. The progress bar dynamically updates to reflect the percentage of completion for each part, and it automatically adjusts when additional progress is added.
