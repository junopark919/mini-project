# Mini-Project

Welcome to the Mini-Project repository! This repository serves as a collection of small projects that I have created for personal practice and learning purposes as I pursue my goal of becoming a front-end developer. Each project is designed to explore different concepts, technologies, and programming languages related to front-end development. Whether you're a beginner looking to practice your skills or an experienced developer seeking to experiment with new ideas, this repository offers a variety of mini-projects to inspire and challenge you.
