# Investment Calculator

This project is an investment calculator created as a task from the "React - The Complete Guide" course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. The initial project was provided by Maximilian Schwarzmüller as part of the course curriculum, and the task was to split the project into components, implement calculate and reset button click events, manage states, and apply styling with CSS modules according to the React concepts learned in the basic React course part.

Please note that the initial project was provided for learning purposes within the course, and its usage beyond that may be subject to the original creator's terms and conditions.
