# User List

The User List App is a project that I created from scratch as a task from the ["React - The Complete Guide" course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). The app allows users to add user data (name and age) through a form, displays the list of users, and shows an error modal if any errors occur during the submission process. This project demonstrates my understanding of React concepts learned in the basic React course part, including creating components, managing states, and handling conditional rendering.

## Usage

This repository, named 'mini-project,' serves as a collection of small projects that I have created for practice and learning purposes. Each project is contained within its own directory and can be explored independently. Here's how you can use this repository:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junopark919/mini-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd user-list
```

3. Follow the project-specific instructions provided in each project's directory.

   - For example, if you want to explore the user list project, navigate to the 'user-list' directory and follow the instructions mentioned in its respective README.

<br>

4. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Start the development server:

```sql
npm start
```

6. Open the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

7. Use the form to add user data (name and age) and observe the list of users being dynamically updated. The error modal will be displayed if any errors occur during the submission process.
