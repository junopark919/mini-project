# Basic Calculator

This is a basic calculator project that I created for practice using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a user-friendly interface with various functions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage calculation, clearing the display, and deleting the last input. The calculator can also be used with a keyboard for convenient input.
